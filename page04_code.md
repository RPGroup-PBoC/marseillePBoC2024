During this course, you will develop a computational prowess that will aid in
your understanding of physical biology.  These will
be done using Jupyter notebooks through [Google
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), so you will need to sign into a
Google Account to create new notebooks.  

We will post links to Jupyter Notebooks hosted on Colab of the tutorial
sessions here.
