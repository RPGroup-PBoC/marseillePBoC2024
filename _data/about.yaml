  Physical Biology of the Cell 
Summary: >
  It is a wonderful time to be thinking about the workings of the living world.
  Historic advances ranging from the use of satellites and drones to track animals
  to the use of biophysical techniques such as optical traps to measure the forces
  applied by molecular motors have provided an unprecedented window on the living.
  The aim of this course is to take a broad view of the use of quantitative
  thinking to query the nature of the living with emphasis on a panoply of
  problems such as the herding of wildebeest, how to think about transcriptomes
  and how living organisms perform tasks that seem to contradict the increase of
  entropy.  We will study these problems using whatever tools we need in order to
  make quantitative and predictive statements about  life. The main intellectual
  thread of the course will be the idea that the type of quantitative data which
  is becoming routine in biology calls for a corresponding quantitative modeling
  framework. The plan of this course is to elucidate general principles with
  exciting case studies and to include abundant opportunities to turn our models
  into computer code using Python that will help us develop our intuition.
